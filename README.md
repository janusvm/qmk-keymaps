# janusvm's QMK keymaps

This repository contains my personal QMK configurations for my keyboards. 
I'm maintaining this as its own thing instead of the recommended fork of [qmk_firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware), as the latter is too cluttered in my opinion.

The focus of these keymaps are generally tailored _very specifically_ to my own taste and needs, which in summary are as follows:

* Colemak-DH layout for alphas
* Easy access to ÆØÅ (Danish letters) and accents
* Split spacebar into (at least) Space and Backspace to make better use of the thumbs
* Symbols accessible close to homerow via layers
